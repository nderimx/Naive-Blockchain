This was an attempt at writing a simple implementation of a blockchain from scratch.
Ended up abandoning java for blockain stuff and left it at just the block and blockchain classes without actualy using them.
The inspiration to write these (rather minimalistic) objects came from [Siraj Raval's repo](https://github.com/llSourcell/The_Power_of_the_blockchain).
